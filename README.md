A collection of "unpopular opinion" and get-rich-quick party spoiler "stop the music" articles on "Is Bitcoin a Ponzi? Is Bitcoin a Speculative Bubble? Is Bitcoin a Digital 21st Century Tulip Mania? Is Bitcoin Comedy Gold?"



From the Wikipedia:

Bitcoin has been described as an economic bubble by at least eight Nobel Prize Economists at various times, including Robert Shiller on 1 March 2014, Joseph Stiglitz on 29 November 2017, and Richard Thaler on 21 December 2017. On 29 January 2018, a noted Keynesian economist Paul Krugman has described bitcoin as "a bubble wrapped in techno-mysticism inside a cocoon of libertarian ideology", on 2 February 2018, professor Nouriel Roubini of New York University has called bitcoin the "mother of all bubbles", and on 27 April 2018, a University of Chicago economist James Heckman has compared it to the 17th-century tulip mania.

On 4 December 2013, Alan Greenspan referred to it as a "bubble" as did George Soros on 25 January 2018. Warren Buffett called bitcoin a "mirage" on 13 March 2014.

Some "unpopular" bitcoin facts:

- Bitcoin Proof-of-Waste Mining Is an Environmental Disaster
- Bitcon Is a Greater Fool BagHODLer Zero-Sum Fraudsters' Greed Fest
- The Bigger the Lies the Better - To the Moon! Number Go Up! Will Quadruple to $100 000 in 2021!
- Bitcoin Is Comedy Gold - Bitcoin Is the New Standard?! - LOL
- When Will the Music Stop? (Hint: Try to Cash Out)

Or how about:

![](bitcoin-net-money-flow.png)

> Bitcoin's money flow is exactly the same as that of a ponzi scheme, as depicted above.
> The arrow in that diagram represents the net one-way flow of money from investors to miners. 
> The net total flow since 2009 is already 15 billion USD. 
> If the the current bitcoin (BTC) price holds, that amount will grow by about 30 million USD/day, 
> or at least another 10 billion USD in the next year. 
> Besides the investors, there isn't (and there will never be) any source of money that could return that money to them.
>
> Even if bitcoin promoters refuse to accept the label "ponzi", 
> they cannot deny that diagram. How can anyone propose such a bottomless barrel as a "store of value".
